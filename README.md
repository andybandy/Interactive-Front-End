# US Birth Data Dashboard
![Preview](images/a.png)

The project is inspired by an article called [“Some people are too superstitious to have a baby on Friday the 13th](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-people-are-too-superstitious-to-have-a-baby-on-friday-the-13th/) written by Carl Bialik. It takes shape of a single web page that reflects US births data (for the years 2000 to 2014) in the form of dynamic data dashboard. The dashboard enables the users to manipulate the information and in turn visualise corresponding statistics. The main purpose of this interactive data panel is not only to prove or contradict the aforementioned article, but also to answer any possible data related questions, hence to satisfy user needs. 

## UX
The UX in this project is focused on the webpage user’s questions regarding the US birth data. Therefore, the visitors are presented with four interactive charts which reflect four data dimensions namely Year, Month, Date and Day. It also contains number box that shows the total number of births depending on the selected time frames. Together, these five instruments enable the users to interactively ask questions such us “how many people celebrate their birthdays only once in four years?”.

In order to enhance user learn-ability every interactive element on the page is of the same color, namely green. Combining the elements this way suggest dashboard users that everything green on the screen is clickable and interactive. Green is the color of choice, since according to [Jennifer Bourn](https://www.bourncreative.com/meaning-of-the-color-green/) it is the color of life, growth and fertility, which clearly corresponds with the project theme.  

Users playing around with the charts might get stuck or simply change their minds regarding the questions. Therefore there is a reset button that brings all the charts to the original state. For those who are confused upon landing, help is only a click away. The question mark icon in the right upper corner, once clicked, brings up the explanation and a walkthrough.
